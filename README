Introduction
------------

automerge is a set of scripts used to manage continuous integration of a
set of branches being developed against mainline. Functionally, it aspires
to do what linux-next does.

ci-merge: The script that actually merges the branches together based on a
	  config file listing the various branches.
ci-report: Reports any warnings/errors resulting from the build
ci-test: Run some tests on the new build


ci-blame: Helper script used to report the commit ID that introduced a new
	  warning/error in the build
ci-config: Helper script that returns the configuration for the branches to
	   be used
ci.conf.sample: Sample configuration file


Getting Started
---------------
Setup a config file. You can do this by creating you own from
ci.conf.sample, e.g. in $HOME/.automerge/config or by setting CONFIG_PATH
environment variable to the path of a valid config file.

Example
-------
$ export CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/work/sources/automerge-qclt-configs.git/automerge-ci.conf
$ export GIT_LOCAL_LINUX_REPO=/work/sources/linux-ci.git
$ export GIT_REMOTE_LINUX_REPO=ssh://git@git.linaro.org/people/amit.kucheria/kernel.git
$ export GIT_LINUX_INTEG_BRANCH=integ
$ ci-merge -l $GIT_LOCAL_LINUX_REPO -r $GIT_REMOTE_LINUX_REPO -i $GIT_LINUX_INTEG_BRANCH -t tag | logger
